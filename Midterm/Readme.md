Rubric: 

business case and value-- what hypotheses are you trying to prove? see above questions
data narrative: tell a story to guide an investor or a retiree or just someone interested in buying...
visualizations, of data prep using first data enrichment (add dataset to base data set) 
feature importance; gini score
Data Prep
feature transformation ;
transform features, add new features to dataset via amalgamations (see below) , compare results with original
data distribution
include dim reduction via: PCA 
Implement 3 amalgamations:
first data set 
second data enrichment [find or scrape a new data set ] -- get an amalgamation; each enrichment enables you to implement / use more algorithms as needed.
How many did you scrape?
Third data enrichment -- scrape data from a source and amalgamate
How many did you scrape?
implement ml algorithms to build models and refine your data narrative
Define a Golden cluster and use Fractal Clustering to find it based on the business case you formulate
train and Apply algorithms : you can use the muller loop
classify: Muller, at least 5 algos
Regression: Muller, at least 7 algos
Compare relevant tasks in the same table.
Write a data narrative to interpret results of each algorithm
Suggest Latent Variables or Latent Manifolds, add then to the features and see how prediction results change
use appropriate metrics for measuring models and compare them in a table: regression metrics and/or classification metrics (confusion matrix, f1)
